# Pursuit - Evasion Games

This repository presents the implementation and experimental validation of a real-time 2-pursuer, 1-evader pursuit-evasion game using holonomic mobile robots constructed from LEGO EV3 kits. The robot configuration enables omnidirectional motion, providing enhanced manoeuvrability in a bounded 2D arena. The motion of all agents is tracked using a high-precision OptiTrack motion capture system. Control decisions are computed in real-time on a central computer using ROS 2 Jazzy, while inter-device communication with the robots is handled via the MQTT protocol to ensure efficient publish-subscribe messaging.

## Problem Overview
Security breaches are becoming a growing concern across multiple sectors, including corporate environments, industrial facilities, and even residential neighbourhoods. Traditional reliance on human security personnel, while valuable, often falls short due to limitations such as restricted working hours, susceptibility to fatigue, delayed response times, and high operational costs. As the demand for more efficient, reliable, and round-the-clock surveillance increases, there is a pressing need to explore automated alternatives.
